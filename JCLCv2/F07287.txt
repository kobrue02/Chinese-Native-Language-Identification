　　有时候，我们需要的正是奋斗。若上帝让我们的生活一帆风顺，那么，我们的人生就会有缺陷。我们也就不能达到我们应有的坚强。
　　我渴求力量
　　上帝给予困难，让我变得强大。
　　我渴求智慧
　　上帝給予困难，让我去解决。
　　我渴求勇气
　　上帝給予危险，让我去征服。
　　我渴求爱
　　上帝給予危难中的人，让我去帮助。
　　我没有得到任何我想要的，我却得到了所以我雪要的。
　　Somethimes struggle are exactly what we need in our life.If God allowed us to go through our without any obstacles,it would cripple us,We would’t be as strong as what we could have been.
　　I asked for strength,and God gave me difficulties to make me strong
　　I asked for wisdom,and 
God gave me problems to solve.
　　I asked for courage ,and God gave me danger to overcome.
　　I asked for love ,and God gave me troubled people to help.
　　I received nothing I wanted.
　　I received everything I needed.
